To do - document how to get creds and how to setup stuff so you can scripts.

To do - document the scripts so folks know what does what (although I may rely on comments in code headers)

Note for Ray: .env for python scripts use this form:

export CLIENT_ID=...
export CLIENT_SECRET=...

I need to rename that to something like, setup.env.py, and ensure I add it to .gitignore
Then I can use .env for my Node scripts
